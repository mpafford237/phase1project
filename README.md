# University Finder

The University Finder is a basic web application that lets you search for universities and add them to a list of favorites.

## How to use the University Finder

Simply type the name of the University you are looking for into the search bar, results will fill automatically. If you are looking for all universities in a specific country, then type the name of the country instead.
